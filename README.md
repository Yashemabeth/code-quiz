# Code-Quiz

## Description

My aim is to create a game that is interactive with the user. The game will include a timer and have buttons you click on to be able to answer questions in the quiz. The quiz will have a start button and buttons to click on to answer questions in the quiz. If the user has not answered the questions before the timer runs out then they lose the game. If the user answers the questions in the quiz correctly then they go on to the next level. If the user answers all the questions right in the second level before the timer is up the hve completely won the game. If however the user answers incorrectly they are a loser and have lose the game. if th user gets to the second level of the game and answers incorrectly then they have lost the quiz.
